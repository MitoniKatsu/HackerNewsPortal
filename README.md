# HackerNews
- This is a sample application to demonstrate some skills in .Net 8 and Angular 19
- On loading the home page, the UI will request a page of the latest news from the backend
  - The backend will return the results immediately if they are cached
  - If results are not cached, they will be fetched from the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
  - The cache has a sliding expiration of 5 minutes, and an absolute expiration of 1 hour
- After the initial latest new is loaded, the user can page through the results, or search them on the search page
  - Search results are in order of relevance to the search terms, and by order in the latest news results
  - Only results that match at least one token (word) of the search terms will be returned
  - If no results are found, the UI will display as such
- If launching this locally, you will have to change the baseUrl in the NewsService.ts
  - Replace the empty string in baseUrl with the baseUrl your backend API is running on
  - This is left empty on release deployment, as both run at the same base url
  - This issue will be fixed once I figure out why Angular is nt following the file replacement instructions in Angular.json for the Environments files
